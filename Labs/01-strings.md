# Lab 01: Working with Strings

1. Assign a variable to a string, with, e.g. `greeting = "hello world"`

2. Then run the `dir()` function on your string, using `dir(greeting)`.  Python will list a bunch of string methods, which are built-in things that you can do with strings. Ignore the ones with double underscores `__` for now. 

3. Try a few string methods on your string variable. For instance, what does `greeting.split()` do? What does `greeting.startswith('g')` do? What does `greeting.isalpha()` return? 

4. Can you divide strings? What about multiplying or adding them?

5. If there's time, browse some of the [documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp) for string methods. 

That's it for now! You don't need to turn anything in for this lab.
