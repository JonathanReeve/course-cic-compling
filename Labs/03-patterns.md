# Computational Linguistics Lab 5: Comparing Languages

1. Choose five languages from the UDHR corpus. Try to include at least one or two languages you know, and one or two non-European languages. 
2. Load those languages and their UDHR translation tokens into a dictionary, with the language or fileid labels as the keys, and the list of words as the values. 
3. Find which language has the shortest words, on average. 
4. Find which language has the longest. 
5. Find which language has the highest lexical diversity (highest type/token ratio), and which the lowest. 
6. Explain, in one paragraph, what you think these findings may mean about the languages.
