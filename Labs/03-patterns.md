# Computational Linguistics Lab 4: Exploring Parts-of-Speech Patterns

1. Choose a text. Any plain text will do, including those included with `nltk.book`. 
2. Tokenize, then part-of-speech-tag that text, using `nltk.pos_tag()`. 
3. Write a function to loop through that tagged list, and find all instances of a three-token pattern in it, where tokens can be either a word, or a POS tag, such as `a JJ man`, or `the best NN`, where JJ is an adjective, and NN is a noun. 
4. Use that function to find a few patterns in your text.
5. Write 1-2 paragraphs where you describe what you notice happening in these patterns.
